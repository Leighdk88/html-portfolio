<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an 8X Salesforce Certified Professional currently employed full time as a Salesforce Administrator who also 
  does freelance Salesforce Consulting for local small businesses. Outside of work I thoroughly enjoy spending time with my beautiful wife and 2 kids.
I am a dedicated freshwater fisherman that not only enjoys the thrill of catching fish but the quiet and relaxing times as well.
Fishing allows me to relax and decompress from all the stresses of life and the world. My target fish of choice is Common Carp and Catfish (Blue, Flathead, Channel, Bullhead).</p>

<p>I am also a Microsoft Certified: Power BI Data Analyst Associate as wells as Professional Scrum Master I certified.
  Other academic notables include me having a Master of Business Administratration with a Concentration in Project Management
and a Bachelor's of Science in Business Marketing. I am a lifelong learning who reads daily while building my knowlege and expertise on the Salesforce platform. I enjoy building
reports, dashboards, and other BI visuals that would help gain insights into data.  </p>

<p>I am currently learning how to be a full stack
  developer by taking trainings on HTML, CSS, and Javascript programming languages. My goal is to become a Salesforce Architect in the next 5 years.
In order to properly achieve this feat I will need to have coding knowledge but I didn't just want the ability to code on the Salesforce platform
knowing only Apex but I want the ability to be a developer beyond Salesforce. Upon finishing my current full stack training I will begin preparation
to take my next Salesforce certification: Platform Developer 1 by the end of 2024. </p>
